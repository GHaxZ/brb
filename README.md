- **Windows**: %APPDATA%\brb\brb.toml
- **macOS**: ~/Library/Application Support/brb/brb.toml

#### Example config:

```toml
# Set custom color

# Either choose from black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, or white:
color = "red"

# Or define a custom RGB color:
# color = { r = 95, g = 126, b = 255 }

# Set the Twitch channel name for the chat
twitch_channel = "ghax_z"

# Set the text in the center
text = "Be right back"

# Enable/disable the chat
chat = true

# Hide the timer after the time is up
hide_timer = true

# Enable/disable the progress bar
progress_bar = true
```
